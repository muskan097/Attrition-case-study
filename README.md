# Attrition-case-study




Attrition is widely understood to be one of the major problems affecting organizations today. In this project, we will study various factors that leads employees to leave the company. The goal of this project is to predict employee attrition using machine learning algorithms so that organization can take steps to keep their employees satisfied.


This project is divided into two parts:
1. Data Preprocessing and data visualisation: checked for missing values and outliers. performed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis using charts and plots for deeper understanding of data. Performed hypothesis testing for every variable with another to gather statistical evidences for the trends observed. The data was suffering from class imbalance problem, used SMOTE technique to balance the predicted class.

2. Training the model: Since this is a classification problem as the predicted class is categorical, trained the data on classification algorithms - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbores, Decision tree with pruning and min leaf, Random forest with max depth. Compared different models based on accuracy, precision, recall and ROC curve.
